## 💡 Project Motivation

We were challenged to create a game application from scratch and wanted to build something unique that other cohorts hadn't attempted before. This project was an opportunity to combine our creativity with the technical skills we developed over 12 weeks at Makers Academy!

## 📚 What We Learned

### Starting Small
Initially, we wanted to use the MERN stack for our project. However, after encountering serious issues getting the project up and running, we took a step back and realized we were overcomplicating things. We learned that it's important to start small and not overwhelm ourselves from the beginning.

### Rapid Learning
Learning to use React and JSX was a huge undertaking in such a short amount of time. We overcame this challenge by:
- Reaching out to coaches and mentors
- Self-led learning and research
- Collaborative problem-solving
- A lot of Googling!

### Recent Refactoring (2026)
The codebase has been modernized with:
- React 18 best practices
- Removal of unnecessary React imports
- Consistent component patterns and prop destructuring
- Improved accessibility with proper alt attributes
- Context API for state management
- Modern routing with React Router v6

## ✨ What Makes This Project Special

### 100% Original
All assets and code in our project are original and created by our team members. Every line of code, every image, and every game mechanic was crafted by us!

### Unique Art Style
Special thanks to **Camilla** and **Mas** for creating all of our custom image assets, which give our game its distinctive prehistoric look and feel!

### Interactive Storytelling
The game combines point-and-click adventure mechanics with detective work, creating an engaging narrative experience.
